README.txt for opencv_example
-----------------------------

This directory has the files to build a simple OpenCV application with
the Stasm library.

To build the application, run make.bat in this directory.

This assumes that you have already installed OpenCV 2.1 and the
Microsoft compiler.

For another example, see ../stasm/testdll.cpp, and references to
it in ../vc10/makefile.
