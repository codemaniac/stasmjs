Reading ../../stasm/data/xm84.shape 12962 mats [1.3 secs]
Ignored 9240 face detector and underscore shapes
Selected a random sample of 70 shapes from 3722 shapes (seed=6)
First few shapes are m000_21 m023_12 m024_12 m025_21 m042_11 ...
Synthesizing 8 eye landmarks for a total of 84 landmarks, synthesized 31 eyes
Reference shape 0000 m000_21 has 84 landmarks
Aligning shapes to m000_21 [0.2 secs]
Outermost landmarks (0,13) angle -9.13 degrees
Eyes (31,36) angle 1.66 degrees
Used only 31 of 70 shapes for eigs because of missing landmarks

Generating ViolaJones mean shape used 31 face det shapes, all from xm84.shape
Generating Rowley mean shape used 31 face det shapes, all from xm84.shape (0 no eyes, 0 one eye)
