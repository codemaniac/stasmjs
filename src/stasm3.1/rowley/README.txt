README for stasm/rowley directory
---------------------------------

There are the files for the Rowley face and eye locator.  The
originals came from http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/NNFaceDetector.  I have
made extensive changes to the files for this project -- you may find
the orginals more to your taste.  Please don't blame Henry for my
changes to his code!  I have removed unused code (including the
training code).  A big thanks to Henry Rowley and his colleagues for
making this software available.

The original files had the following header:
By Henry A. Rowley (har@cs.cmu.edu, http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~har)
Developed at Carnegie Mellon University for the face detection project.
Code may be used, but please provide appropriate acknowledgements, and let
har@cs.cmu.edu how you are using it.  Thanks!
